[[_sec.user.services.overview]]
== Overview

{kube}
services abstract a set of pods and a policy to access them.
Services can be exposed outside the cluster. 

For details, refer to {kubedoc}concepts/services-networking/service/. 

[[_sec.user.services.create]]
== Creating Services


To create a service, specify it in a YAML file.
The following example YAML file is a very basic service definition.
It forwards incoming network packages on port `80` to all pods with the label `MyApp` on port ``9376``. 

.Basic Service Definition
====
----
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9376
----
====


Apply the YAML file with [command]``kubectl create -f
   `YAML_FILE```. 

The IP address can be retrieved with the command [command]``kubectl
   describe services my-service``.
Additionally, a DNS record will be created with the schema [systemitem]``SERVICE_NAME.
   NAMESPACE_NAME``
.
If the the example above is created in the namespace ``my-ns``, the DNS record would be ``my-service.my-ns``. 

[[_sec.user.services.remove]]
== Removing Services


To delete a service, use [command]``kubectl delete service
   `SERVICE_NAME```.
