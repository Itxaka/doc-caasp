= About the Making of This Documentation
:imagesdir: ./images


This documentation is written in SUSEDoc, a subset of http://www.docbook.org[DocBookÂ 5].
The XML source files were validated by `jing` (see https://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/), processed by `xsltproc`, and converted into XSL-FO using a customized version of Norman Walsh's stylesheets.
The final PDF is formatted through FOP from https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop[Apache
  Software Foundation].
The open source tools and the environment used to build this documentation are provided by the DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite (DAPS). The project's home page can be found at https://github.com/openSUSE/daps.
