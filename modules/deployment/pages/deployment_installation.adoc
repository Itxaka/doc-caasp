This chapter gives an overview on how to run through a default installation of {productname}
for the {amd64}
/{intel64}
architecture.

[[_sec.caasp.installquick]]
== Installing {productname}


Use the following procedures to set up a new {productnamereg}{productnumber}
cluster.

There are two ways to build a cluster, one of which has two variants.

* Installing nodes from installation media (for virtual machines, directly from ISO images, or physical media for bare-metal installations).
+
.{Admin_Node}
WARNING: You must install the {admin_node}
first and configure it using {dashboard}
before installing the other nodes in the cluster.
+


+
With this method, there are two ways to install the worker nodes:
** Individually, choosing the node type during installation. This is only feasible for a small number of workers.
** Installing the worker nodes using {ay} so that they receive their configuration automatically from the {admin_node} . This is the recommended method for larger clusters, but it is equally suitable for small clusters.

+
With both methods, the procedure to install the {admin_node}
is identical.
Only installation process for the {worker_node}
s differs.
* Using preinstalled virtual disk images. {suse} offers `QCOW2` images for clusters hosted on KVM or {xen} hypervisors.


[NOTE]
====
It is possible to start setup using PXE.
For the full procedure, refer to the {sle}
12 Deployment Guide: https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_sle_deployment/book_sle_deployment.html#cha.deployment.prep_boot.

You can directly use the `initrd` and `linux` files from your install media, or install the package [package]#tftpboot-installation-CAASP-3.0#
 onto your TFTP server.
The package provides the required `initrd` and `linux` files in the [path]``/srv/tftpboot/``
 directory.
You will need to modify the paths used in the {sle}
 12 Deployment Guide to correctly point to the files provided by the package.

=== Installation from ISO images or media

[[_sec.caasp.installquick.admin]]
==== Installing the {Admin_Node}


The procedure for installing the {admin_node}
is identical whether or not you use {ay}
for the rest of the cluster.

[[_pro.caasp.installquick.admin]]

. Connect or insert the {productname} installation media, then reboot the computer to start the installation program. On machines with a traditional BIOS, you will see the graphical boot screen shown below. The boot screen on machines equipped with UEFI is slightly different.
+
SecureBoot on UEFI machines is supported.
+
Use kbd:[F2]
to change the language for the installer.
A corresponding keyboard layout is chosen automatically.
See https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_deployment/data/sec_i_yast2_startup.html for more information about changing boot options.
+


image::install_boot.png[scaledwidth=100%]
. Select menu:Installation[] on the boot screen, then press kbd:[Enter] . This boots the system and loads the {productname} installer.
. {empty}
+
Configure the following mandatory settings on the menu:Installation Overview[]
screen.
+
.Help and Release Notes
NOTE: From this point on, a brief help document and the Release Notes can be viewed from any screen during the installation process by selecting menu:Help[]
 or menu:Release Notes[]
 respectively.
+


+

Keyboard Layout :::
The menu:Keyboard Layout[]
is initialized with the language settings you have chosen on the boot screen.
Change it here, if necessary.

Password for {rootuser}:::
Type a password for the system administrator account (called the {rootuser}
user) and confirm it.
+

.Do not forget the {rootuser}Password
WARNING: You must not lose the {rootuser}
password! After you enter it here, the password cannot be retrieved.
For more information, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_deployment/data/sec_i_yast2_user_root.html.
+


Registration Code or SMT Server URL :::
Enter the menu:Registration Code or SMT Server URL[]
.
SMT Server URLs must use `https` or ``http``; other protocols are not supported.

System Role :::
From the menu:System Role[]
menu, choose menu: Administration Node (Dashboard)[]
.

NTP Servers :::
Enter the host names or IP addresses of one or more menu:NTP Servers[]
for the node, separated by colons or white space.
A single time server is sufficient, but for optimal precision and reliability, nodes should use at least three.
+
For more information about ``NTP``, refer to https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_admin/data/cha_netz_xntp.html

+


image::install_overview_admin.png[scaledwidth=100%]

+
Optionally, you can customize the following settings.
If you do not make any changes, defaults are used.
A brief summary of the settings is displayed below the respective settings option.
+

Partitioning :::
Review the partition setup proposed by the system and change it if necessary.
You have the following options:

Select a hard disk ::::
Select a disk on to which to install {productname}
with the recommended partitioning scheme.

menu:Custom Partitioning (for Experts)[]::::
Opens the menu:Expert Partitioner[]
described in https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_deployment/data/sec_yast2_i_y2_part_expert.html.
+

.For Experts only
WARNING: As the name suggests, the menu:Expert Partitioner[]
 is for experts only.
Custom partitioning schemes that do not meet the requirements of {productname}
 are not supported.

.Requirements for custom partitioning schemes
**** {productname} only supports the {btrfs} file system with OverlayFS. A read-only {btrfs} file system is used for the root file system, which enables transactional updates.
**** For snapshots, partitions must have a capacity of at least 11 GB.
**** Depending on the number and size of your containers, you will need sufficient space under the `/var` mount point.

+


+
To accept the proposed setup without any changes, choose menu:Next[]
to proceed.

Booting :::
This section shows the boot loader configuration.
Changing the defaults is only recommended if really needed.
For details, refer to https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_admin/data/cha_grub2.html.

Network Configuration :::
If the network could not be configured automatically while starting the installation system, you must manually configure the menu:Network Settings[]
.
Please make sure at least one network interface is connected to the Internet in order to register your product.
+
By default, the installer requests a host name from the DHCP server.
If you set a custom name in the menu:Hostname/DNS[]
tab, make sure that it is unique.
+
For more information on configuring network connections, refer to https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_admin/data/sec_basicnet_yast.html .

Kdump :::
Kdump saves the memory image ("`core dump`"
) to the file system in case the kernel crashes.
This enables you to find the cause of the crash by debugging the dump file.
See https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_tuning/data/cha_tuning_kdump_basic.html for more information.
+

.Kdump with large amounts of RAM
WARNING: If you have a system with large amounts of RAM or a small hard drive, core dumps may not be able to fit on the disk.
If the installer warns you about this, there are two options:
... Enter the menu:Expert Partitioner[] and increase the size of the root partition so that it can accommodate the size of the core dump. In this case, you will need to decrease the size of the data partition accordingly. Remember to keep all other parameters of the partitioning (e.g. the root file system, mount point of data partition) when doing these changes.
... Disable kdump completely.

+


System Information :::
View detailed hardware information by clicking menu:System Information[]
.
In this screen you can also change menu:Kernel Settings[]
.
See https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_tuning/data/cha_tuning_io.html for more information.

+
Proceed with menu:Next[]
.
+
.Installing Product Patches at Installation Time
TIP: If {productname}
has been successfully registered at the {scc}
, you are asked whether to install the latest available online updates during the installation.
If you choose menu:Yes[]
, the system will be installed with the most current packages without having to apply the updates after installation.
Activating this option is recommended.
+

. After you have finalized the system configuration on the menu:Installation Overview[] screen, click menu:Install[] . Up to this point no changes have been made to your system.
+
Click menu:Install[]
a second time to start the installation process.
+


image::install_confirm.png[scaledwidth=100%]

+


image::install_perform.png[scaledwidth=100%]
. After the installation routine has finished, the computer will reboot into the installed system.


[[_sec.caasp.installquick.conf]]
==== {Admin_Node} Configuration


Before installing the other nodes, it is necessary to configure the {admin_node}
.

[[_pro.caasp.installquick.conf]]

. After the {admin_node} has finished booting and you see the login prompt, point a web browser to:
+
https://caasp-admin.example.com
+
... where `caasp-admin.{exampledomain}` is the host name or IP address of the {admin_node}
.
The host name and IP address are both shown on the {admin_node}
console, above the login prompt.
+
. To create an Administrator account, click menu:Create an account[] and provide an e-mail address and a password. Confirm the password and click menu:Create Admin[] . You will be logged into the dashboard automatically.
+


image::velum_register.png[scaledwidth=100%]
. Fill in the values for menu:Dashboard Location[] and menu:External Kubernetes API server FQDN[] . If necessary, configure the menu:Proxy Settings[] .
+

Dashboard Location:::
Host name or IP of the node running this web interface.

External Kubernetes API server FQDN:::
Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) used to reach the cluster from the outside.
In a simple, single-master deployment this will be the FQDN of the node you are about to select as master.

Install Tiller (Helm's Server Component):::
If you intend to deploy {scf}
on {productname}
, or any other software that is installed with {helm}
(the {kube}
package manager), check the box to install {tiller}
.

Proxy Settings:::
If enabled, you can set proxy servers for `HTTP` and ``HTTPS``.
You may also configure exceptions and choose whether to apply the settings only to the container engine or to all processes running on the cluster nodes.

+


image::velum_install_tiller.png[scaledwidth=100%]

+
Click menu:Next[]
to proceed and install some cluster nodes as described in <<_sec.caasp.installquick.node>>.


[[_sec.caasp.installquick.node]]
==== Installing {Worker_Node} s

[WARNING]
====
Before you can install the {worker_node}
s of your new cluster, you must install and configure the {admin_node}
.
Ensure that you have completed the steps in <<_sec.caasp.installquick.admin>> and <<_sec.caasp.installquick.conf>>.
====

[[_sec.caasp.installquick.node.manual]]
===== Manual Installation

[[_pro.caasp.installquick.node.manual]]

. Follow the same procedure as for installing the {admin_node} in <<_sec.caasp.installquick.admin>>, up until selection of the menu:System Role[] .
. Select `Cluster Node` as menu:System Role[] and enter the host name or IP address of the {admin_node} .
+
.Plain System
NOTE: It is also possible to select a third node type, of "plain node". These can be used for testing and debugging purposes, but are not usually needed.
+

. After you have finalized the system configuration on the menu:Installation Overview[] screen, click menu:Install[] . Up to this point no changes have been made to your system. After you click menu:Install[] a second time, the installation process starts.
+
After a reboot, the worker should show up in the dashboard and can be added to your cluster.
+
Repeat this procedure at least twice more to add a minimum of three {worker_node}
s.
This is the minimum supported size for a {productname}
cluster.


[[_sec.caasp.installquick.node.ay]]
===== Automatic Installation Using {ay}


Before installing {worker_node}
s with {ay}
, you must have the URL of the {ay}
file on the {admin_node}
.
Generally this will supplied by the dashboard on the {admin_node}
.
[[_pro.caasp.installquick.node.ay]]

. Insert the {productname} DVD into the drive, then reboot the computer to start the installation program.
. {empty}
+


image::install_boot_ay.png[scaledwidth=100%]

+
Select menu:Installation[]
on the boot screen, but _do not_ press kbd:[Enter]
.
+
Before proceeding to boot the machine, you must enter the necessary menu:Boot Options[]
for {ay}
and networking.
+
The most important two are:
+

autoyast= :::
Path to the {ay}
file.
It is in the form of a URL built from the FQDN of the {admin_node}
, followed the path to the {ay}
file.
For example, `http://admin.example.com/autoyast`
+
For more information, refer to https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_autoyast/data/invoking_autoinst.html#commandline_ay

netsetup= :::
Network configuration.
If you are using dhcp, you can simply enter ``netsetup=dhcp``.
For manual configuration, refer to https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_autoyast/data/ay_adv_network.html.

hostname :::
The host name for the node, if not provided by DHCP.
If you manually specify a host name, make sure it is unique.

+
Press kbd:[Enter]
.
This boots the system and loads the {productname}
installer.
. So long as there are no errors, the rest of the installation should complete automatically. After a reboot, the new {worker_node} should show up in the dashboard and can be added to your cluster.


[[_sec.caasp.installquick.bootstrap]]
=== Bootstrapping the Cluster


To complete the installation of your {productname}
cluster, it is necessary to bootstrap at least three additional nodes; those will be the {kube}
master and workers.

[[_pro.caasp.installquick.bootstrap]]

. Point a web browser to https://caasp-admin.example.com to open the dashboard, where `caasp-admin.{exampledomain}` is the host name or IP address of the {admin_node} .
. The dashboard lists all cluster nodes registered at the {admin_node} . Newly installed nodes are be listed as menu:Pending Nodes[] . You can accept individual nodes or all by clicking menu:Accept All Nodes[] .
+


image::velum_nodes.png[scaledwidth=100%]

+
Use the check box in the first column to select the nodes you want to add to your cluster.
In the last column, select the one that should become {kube}
master.
All other nodes will be set to the worker role once you click menu:Bootstrap cluster[]
.
. Please wait while the cluster is bootstrapped. Once finished, the status indicator icon of the nodes changes accordingly and you can download the [command]``kubectl`` configuration file.
