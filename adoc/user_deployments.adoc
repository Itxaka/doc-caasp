[[_sec.user.deployments.overview]]
== Overview


Deployments can be used for declarative updates of Pods and ReplicaSets.
The desired state is described in a Deployment object and the Deployment controller then changes the state in a controlled rate. 

For details, refer to https://v1-11.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/. 

== Creating a Deployment


The following example illustrates a basic Deployment: 

----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
----


To create a Deployment from a YAML file, use [command]``kubectl create
   -f [replaceable]``FILE_NAME````. 

To delete a Deployment, use [command]``kubectl delete
   [replaceable]``DEPLOYMENT_NAME````.
