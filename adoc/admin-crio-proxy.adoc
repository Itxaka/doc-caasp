== Configuring HTTP/HTTPS proxy for {crio}

In some cases you must configure the container runtime to use a proxy to pull
container images. To configure this for {crio} you must modify the file
`/etc/sysconfig/crio`.

. First define the hostnames that should be used without a proxy (`NO_PROXY`).
. Then define which proxies should be used by the HTTP and HTTPS connections
(`HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`).
. After you have saved the changes restart the container runtime with
+
----
root# systemctl restart crio
