With a ReplicaSet you can ensure that a specified number of replicated pods is running.
ReplicaSet allows you to use __selectors__.
Selectors allow selecting objects by labels.
Usually, Deployments should be used instead of ReplicaSets.
Deployments are a higher-level concept, that manages ReplicaSets.
For more details, see <<_cha.user.deployments>>.
