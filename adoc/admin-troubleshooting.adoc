//= Troubleshooting

This chapter summarizes frequent problems that can occur while using {productname}
and their solutions.

Additionally, {suse} support collects problems and their solutions online at link:https://www.suse.com/support/kb/?id=SUSE_CaaS_Platform[] .

== The `supportconfig` tool

As a first step for any troubleshooting/debugging effort, you need to find out
where the problem is caused. For this purpose we ship the `supportconfig` tool
and plugin with {productname}. With a simple command you can collect and compile
a variety of details about your cluster to enable {suse} support to pinpoint
the potential cause of an issue.

In case of problems, a detailed system report can be created with the
`supportconfig` command line tool. It will collect information about the system such as:

* Current Kernel version
* Hardware information
* Installed packages
* Partition setup
* Cluster and node status

[TIP]
====
A full list of of the data collected by `supportconfig` can be found under
https://github.com/SUSE/supportutils-plugin-suse-caasp/blob/master/README.md.
====

To collect all relevant logs run the `supportconfig` command on all the master
and worker nodes individually.

[source,bash]
----
sudo supportconfig
sudo tar -xvJf /var/log/nts_*.txz
cd /var/log/nts*
sudo cat kubernetes.txt crio.txt
----

The result is a TAR archive of files. Each of the tar files should be given a name that can be used to identify which
cluster node it was created on.

After opening a Service Request (SR), you can upload the TAR archives to Global Technical Support.

The data will help to locate the issue you reported and assist you in solving the problem.
