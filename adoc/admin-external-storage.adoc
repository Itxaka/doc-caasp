= Configuring External Storage

Because {productname} delivers the minimum packages required to support kubernetes not every package needed for every backing storage solution will be installed on the nodes. As each node is {sle}, you can use your already in place tools for deploying and managing packages.

If using autoyast or terraform these packages can easily be installed when initializing the node.

As an example, Ceph requires the folowing packages to be installed:

* `nfs-client`
* `xfsprogs`
* `ceph-common`
