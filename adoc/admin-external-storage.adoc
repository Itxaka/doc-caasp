= Configuring External Storage

Because {productname} delivers the minimum packages required to support {kube} not every package needed for every backing storage solution will be installed on the nodes.
As each node is {sle}, you can use your already in place tools for deploying and managing packages.

If using {ay} or {tf} these packages can easily be installed when initializing the node.

As an example, `Ceph` requires the following packages to be installed:

* `nfs-client`
* `xfsprogs`
* `ceph-common`

For a more detailed example you can refer to: <<ses-integration>>.
