= NGINX Ingress Controller

Configure and deploy NGINX ingress controller

. Choose which networking configuration the ingress controller should have.
Create a file [path]`nginx-ingress-config-values.yaml` with one of the following examples as content.

* **NodePort**: The services will be publicly exposed on each node of the cluster, including master nodes, at port `30443` for `HTTPS`.
+
----
# Enable the creation of pod security policy
podSecurityPolicy:
  enabled: true

# Create a specific service account
serviceAccount:
  create: true
  name: nginx-ingress

# Publish services on port HTTPS/30443
# These services are exposed on each node
controller:
  service:
    enableHttp: false
    type: NodePort
    nodePorts:
      https: 30443
