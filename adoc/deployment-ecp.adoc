== Deployment on SUSE OpenStack Cloud

You will use terrafrom to deploy the cluster nodes to {soc} and then use the
`caaspctl` tool to bootstrap the cluster.

=== Preparation

You need terraform installed on your workstation and configure access to the {soc} API.

. Install terraform on your local machine.
+
Select the appropriate repository from here: https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:terraform
Add the repository to your workstation (here Tumbleweed):
+
----
sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/terraform/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/ terraform
----
. Install terraform
+
----
zypper in terraform
----
. Download the SUSE OpenStack Cloud RC file.
.. Log in to SUSE OpenStack Cloud.
.. Click on your username in the upper right hand corner to reveal the dropdown menu.
.. Click on menu:Download OpenStack RC File v3[].
.. Save the file to your workstation.
.. Load the file into your shell environment.
+
----
source container-openrc.sh
----
.. Enter the password for the RC file. This should be same credentials that you use to log in to {soc}.

=== Deploying the cluster nodes

. Install `caaspctl` from the repository:
+
[subs=attributes]
----
sudo zypper ar {caasp_repo_url} caaspctl
sudo zypper in caaspctl
----
. Switch to the directory `/usr/share/caasp/terraform/openstack/`.
. Create a file `terraform.tfvars` or just copy the existing `terraform.tfvars.sles.example` to it
+
include::deployment-terraform-example.adoc[tags=tf.default]
. Replace `internal_net` and `stack_name` with your desired name for the cluster. This string will be used to generate the human readable IDs in {soc}.
If you use a generic term it is very likely to fail deployment because the term is already in use by someone else. It's a good idea to use your username or other unique identifier.
. You can adjust the size of the deployed cluster by changing the "masters" and "workers" variables.
. Insert your public SSH key into the "authorized keys" variable. This key will be distributed to all machines and is your login credentials for all cluster nodes.
. Make sure to set the correct NTP time servers for your infrastructure
. You can set timezone in before deploying the nodes by modifying the files:
+
* `/usr/share/caasp/terraform/openstack/cloud-init/master.tpl`
* `/usr/share/caasp/terraform/openstack/cloud-init/worker.tpl`
. Now you can deploy the nodes by running:
----
terraform init
terraform apply
----

Check the output for the actions to be taken. Type "yes" and confirm with Enter when ready.
Terraform will now provision all the machines and network infrastructure for the cluster.

.Note down IP/FQDN for nodes
[IMPORTANT]
====
The IP addresses of the generated machines will be displayed in the terraform
output during the cluster node deployment. You need these IP addresses to
deploy {productname} to the cluster.

If you need to find an IP addresses later on you can run `terraform output` within the `caaspctl/ci/infra/openstack` directory or perform the following steps:

. Log in to {soc} and click on menu:Network[Load Balancers]. Find the one with the string you entered in the terraform configuration above e.g. "testing-lb".
. Note down the "Floating IP". If you have configured a FQDN for this IP, use the hostname instead.
+

. Now click on menu:Compute[Instances].
. Switch the filter dropdown to `Instance Name` and enter the string you specified for `stack_name` in the `terraform.tfvars` file.
. Find the Floating IPs on each of the nodes of your cluster.
