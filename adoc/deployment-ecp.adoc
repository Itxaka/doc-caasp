== Deployment on SUSE OpenStack Cloud

.Preparation Required
[NOTE]
You must have completed <<deployment.preparations>> to proceed.

You will use {tf} to deploy the required master and worker cluster nodes (plus a load balancer) to {soc} and then use the
`skuba` tool to bootstrap the {kube} cluster on top of those.

. Download the SUSE OpenStack Cloud RC file.
.. Log in to SUSE OpenStack Cloud.
.. Click on your username in the upper right hand corner to reveal the dropdown menu.
.. Click on menu:Download OpenStack RC File v3[].
.. Save the file to your workstation.
.. Load the file into your shell environment.
+
----
source container-openrc.sh
----
.. Enter the password for the RC file. This should be same credentials that you use to log in to {soc}.
. Get the SLES15-SP1 image.
.. Download the pre-built image of SUSE SLES15-SP1 for {soc} from {jeos_product_page_url}.
.. Upload the image to your {soc}.

=== Deploying the cluster nodes

. Find the {tf} template files for {soc} in `/usr/share/caasp/terraform/openstack`.
Copy this folder to a location of your choice as the files need adjustment.
+
----
mkdir -p ~/caasp/deployment/
cp -r /usr/share/caasp/terraform/openstack/ ~/caasp/deployment/
cd ~/caasp/deployment/openstack/
----
. Once the files are copied, rename the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to
`terraform.tfvars`:
+
----
mv terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
----
. Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file and add modify the following variables:
+
include::deployment-terraform-example.adoc[tags=tf_openstack]
+
[TIP]
====
You can set timezone in before deploying the nodes by modifying the files:

* `~/my-deployment/cloud-init/master.tpl`
* `~/my-deployment/cloud-init/worker.tpl`
====
. Enter the registration code for your nodes in `~/my-deployment/registration.auto.tfvars`:
+
Substitute `REGISTRATION_CODE` for the code from <<registration_code>>.
+
[source,json]
----
# SUSE CaaSP Product Registration Code
caasp_registry_code = "REGISTRATION_CODE"
----
+
This is required so all the deployed nodes can automatically register to {scc} and retrieve packages.
. Now you can deploy the nodes by running:
+
----
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
----
+
Check the output for the actions to be taken. Type "yes" and confirm with Enter when ready.
Terraform will now provision all the machines and network infrastructure for the cluster.
+
.Note down IP/FQDN for nodes
[IMPORTANT]
====
The IP addresses of the generated machines will be displayed in the terraform
output during the cluster node deployment. You need these IP addresses to
deploy {productname} to the cluster.

If you need to find an IP addresses later on you can run `terraform output` within the directory you performed the deployment from `~/my-deployment` directory or perform the following steps:

. Log in to {soc} and click on menu:Network[Load Balancers]. Find the one with the string you entered in the terraform configuration above e.g. "testing-lb".
. Note down the "Floating IP". If you have configured a FQDN for this IP, use the hostname instead.
+
image::deploy-loadbalancer-ip.png[]
. Now click on menu:Compute[Instances].
. Switch the filter dropdown to `Instance Name` and enter the string you specified for `stack_name` in the `terraform.tfvars` file.
. Find the Floating IPs on each of the nodes of your cluster.
