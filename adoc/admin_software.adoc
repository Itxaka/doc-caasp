[[_sec.admin.software.transactional_updates]]
== Transactional Updates


For security and stability reasons, the operating system and application should always be up-to-date.
While with a single machine you can keep the system up-to-date quite easily by running several commands, in a large-scale cluster the update process can become a real burden.
Thus transactional automatic updates have been introduced.
Transactional updates can be characterized as follows: 

* They are atomic. 
* They do not influence the running system. 
* They can be rolled back. 
* The system needs to be rebooted to activate the changes. 


Transactional updates are managed by the [command]``transactional-update`` script, which is called once a day.
The script checks if any updates are available.
If there are any updates to be applied, a new snapshot of the root file system is created in the background and is updated from the release channels.
All updates released to this point are applied.
The running file system/machine state is left untouched. 

The new snapshot, once completely updated, is then marked as active and will be used as the new default after the next reboot of the system. 

.Snapshot Activation
[NOTE]
====
For each "transaction" performed by [command]``transactional-updates`` a new snapshot is generated and requires a reboot to incorporate the changes.
If another transaction is run before the reboot, only the latest snapshot is used and changes might be lost.
If you perform manual updates or installation on your nodes, please make sure to reboot after each transaction.
Refer to: <<_sec.admin.software.transactional_updates.installation.manual>>. 
====

{dashboard}
will show a list of nodes that have new updates available for use.
The cluster administrator then uses {dashboard}
to reboot the nodes to the new snapshots to ensure the health of services and configuration. {dashboard}
uses [command]``salt`` to safely disable services on the nodes, apply new snapshots, rewrite configurations and then bring the services and nodes back up. 

[[_sec.admin.software.transactional_updates.command]]
=== The [command]``transactional-update`` Command

.Only use when requested by SUSE Support
[IMPORTANT]
====
This reference for [command]``transactional-update`` should only be used when requested by SUSE Support.
Updates are handled by an automated process and only require user interaction for rebooting of nodes. 
====


The [command]``transactional-update`` enables you to install or remove updates of your system in an atomic way.
The updates are applied all or none of them if any package cannot be installed.
Before the update is applied, a snapshot of the system is created in order to restore the previous state in case of a failure. 

If the current root file system is identical to the active root file system (after applying updates and reboot), run cleanup of all old snapshots: 

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update cleanup`` 
----


Other options of the command are the following: 

`pkg in/install`::
Installs individual packages from the available channels using the [command]``zypper install`` command.
This command can also be used to install PTF RPM files.
Please note that the changes to the base file system only become permanent after a reboot. 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update pkg install PACKAGE_NAME`` 
----
+
or
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update pkg install RPM1 RPM2`` 
----
`pkg rm/remove`::
Removes individual packages from the active snapshot using the [command]``zypper remove`` command.
This command can also be used to remove PTF RPM files.
Please note that the changes to the base file system only become permanent after a reboot. 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update pkg remove PACKAGE_NAME`` 
----
`pkg up/update`::
Updates individual packages from the active snapshot using the [command]``zypper update`` command.
This command can also be used to update PTF RPM files.
Please note that only packages that are part of the snapshot of the base file system can be updated and changes only become permanent after a reboot. 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update pkg remove PACKAGE_NAME`` 
----
`up/update`::
If there are new updates available, a new snapshot is created and [command]``zypper up/update`` is used to update the snapshot.
The snapshot is activated afterwards and is used as the new root file system after reboot. 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update up`` 
----
`dup`::
If there are new updates available, a new snapshot is created and [command]``zypper dup â€“no-allow-vendor-change`` is used to update the snapshot.
The snapshot is activated afterwards and is used as the new root file system after reboot. 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update dup`` 
----
`patch`::
If there are new updates available, a new snapshot is created and [command]``zypper patch`` is used to update the snapshot.
The snapshot is activated afterwards and is used as the new root file system after reboot. 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update patch`` 
----
`rollback`::
The command sets the default sub volume.
On systems with read-write file system [command]``snapper rollback`` is called.
On a read-only file system and without any argument, the current system is set to a new default root file system.
If you specify a number, that snapshot is used as the default root file system.
On a read-only file system, no additional snapshots are created. 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update rollback SNAPSHOT_NUMBER`` 
----
`grub.cfg`::
The command creates a new grub2 config.
Sometimes it is necessary to adjust the boot configuration, e.g.
by adding additional kernel parameters.
This can be done by editing [replaceable]``/etc/default/grub``, calling [command]``transactional-update grub.cfg`` and then rebooting the machine to activate the change.
Please note that without rebooting the machine, the new grub config will be overwritten with the default by any transactional-update that takes place. 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update grub.cfg`` 
----
`reboot`::
This parameter triggers a reboot after the action is completed. 
+
How the reboot is done depends on how [command]``transactional-update`` is configured.
For cluster nodes this will set a Salt grain to show the updated node in {dashboard}
as requiring reboot. 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update dup reboot`` 
----
`--help`::
The option outputs possible options and subcommands. 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update --help`` 
----

[[_sec.admin.software.transactional_updates.disabling]]
=== Disabling Transactional Updates


Even though it is not recommended, you can disable transactional updates by issuing the command: 

----
{prompt.root}``systemctl --now disable transactional-update.timer`` 
----

.Disabling transaction update timer is required during upgrade
[NOTE]
====
You must disable transactional updates during the upgrade procedure from one version of {productname}
to the next. 
====

[[_sec.admin.software.transactional_updates.installation]]
=== Applying Updates


It is paramount that you never "hard reboot" nodes in the cluster after transactional updates.
This will omit reconfiguring services and applications and will leave nodes in unhealthy, if not unsusable, states. 

Updates are typically applied to nodes automatically and will be flagged in {dashboard}
for reboot.
If you have nodes with pending transactional updates follow the steps below. 

.General Notes to the Updates Installation
[NOTE]
====
Only packages that are part of the snapshot of the root file system can be updated.
If packages contain files that are not part of the snapshot, the update could fail or break the system. 

RPMs that require a license to be accepted cannot be updated. 
====


After the [command]``transactional-update`` script has run on all nodes, {dashboard}
 displays any nodes in your cluster running outdated software.
The updates are only applied after a reboot.
For this purpose, {dashboard}
 enables you to update your cluster directly.
Follow the next procedure to update your cluster. 

.Procedure: Updating the Cluster with {dashboard}
. Login to {dashboard} . 
. If required, click menu:UPDATE ADMIN NODE[] to start the update. 
+


image::velum_updating.png[scaledwidth=100%]
. Confirm the update by clicking menu:Reboot to update[] . 
+


image::velum_reboot_and_update.png[scaledwidth=100%]
. Now you have to wait until the {admin_node} reboots and {dashboard} is available again. 
. Click menu:update all nodes[] to update {master_node} and {worker_node} s. 
+


image::velum_update_nodes.png[scaledwidth=100%]


[[_sec.admin.software.transactional_updates.installation.manual]]
==== Applying Updates Manually


You can use [command]``transactional-update`` to apply updates or install PTF files manually. 

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update pkg install PACKAGE_NAME reboot`` 
----


If your node is accepted to the cluster, it will have been configured to use Salt orchestration to reboot.
The updated node will show in {dashboard}
requiring a reboot. 

If your node is not (yet) accepted into the cluster it will reboot after the transactional-update has finished. 

[[_sec.admin.software.transactional_updates.recovering]]
=== Recovering From Failed Updates


Velum notifies you about failed updates.
If the update failed, there are several things that can be the cause.
The following list provides an overview of things to check.
For general information about troubleshooting, read <<_sec.admin.troubleshooting.overview>>. 

.Do Not Interfere with Transactional Updates
[WARNING]
====
Do not manually interfere with transactional updates.
Do so only if you are requested to do so by {suse}
support. 

For details, see <<_sec.admin.software.transactional_updates.command>>. 
====

Stopping Services and Reboot::
Velum uses {salt}
to stop all services and reboot the node.
Salt also takes care of adjusting configuration.
Check the logs of the {salt}
master and minions for error messages.
For details, see <<_sec.admin.logging.salt.master>> and <<_sec.admin.logging.salt.minion>>. 

Installing Updates::
Updates are installed once a day but only applied after a reboot is manually triggered.
If the installation of updates fails, Velum shows the message `Update Failed` as the node's status.
In this case, log in on the node and check [path]``/var/log/transactional-update.log``
for problems. 

Starting Services::
Finally, all services of the node are being restarted.
Look which services have failed by executing [command]``systemctl
list-units --failed``.
Then check the logs of failed services. 


The following procedure can help in some situations. 


. Reboot all nodes. 
+

----
{prompt.root.admin}``docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f name="salt-master") \
salt -P "roles:(admin|kube-(master|minion))" system.reboot`` 
----
. On the {admin_node} run 
+

----
{prompt.root.admin}``docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f name="salt-master") \
 salt -P "roles:(admin|kube-(master|minion))" cmd.run "transactional-update cleanup reboot dup"`` 
----
. Reboot all nodes again. 
+

----
{prompt.root.admin}``docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f name="salt-master") \
salt -P "roles:(admin|kube-(master|minion))" system.reboot`` 
----
. Start the update with debug output. 
+

----
{prompt.root.admin}``docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f name="salt-master") \
salt-run -l debug state.orchestrate orch.update`` 
----
. If there is any ongoing problem, look at all the {salt} grains of all nodes in [path]``/etc/salt/grains`` . This file contains the status if the update is ongoing, and is therefore providing the "Update Retry" in Velum. 


[[_sec.admin.software.patch]]
== Program Temporary Fixes


Program temporary fixes (PTFs) are available in the {productname}
environment.
You install them by using the [command]``transactional-update`` script.
Typically you invoke the installation of PTFs by running: 

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update reboot ptf install RPM1 RPM2 â€¦`` 
----


The command installs PTF RPMs.
The `reboot` option then schedules a reboot after the installation.
PTFs are activate only after rebooting of your system. 

.Reboot Required
[NOTE]
====
If you install or remove PTFs and you call the [command]``transactional-update`` to update the system before reboot, the applied changes by PTFs are lost and need to be done again after reboot. 
====


In case you need to remove the installed PTFs, use the following command: 

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update reboot ptf remove RPM1 RPM2 â€¦`` 
----

[[_sec.admin.software.upgrade_caasp2]]
== Upgrading From {productname} 2

.Read This Section Carefully
[WARNING]
====
Before executing the single steps of the upgrade procedure, carefully read all information in this overview section. 
====


As {productname}
is constantly developed and improved, new versions get released.
You are strongly advised to upgrade to a supported release.
These upgrades may involve manual intervention. 
[[_pro.admin.upgrade.procedure]]
.Procedure: Overview of Upgrade Procedure
. Plan a maintenance window. Upgrades may take some time, during which services may be degraded in performance or completely unavailable. 
. If you are using _{rmtool}_ or __{smtool}__, enable the {productname} 3 repositories and mirror the packages. 
. Install all updates for {productname} 2. For details, see <<_sec.admin.software.upgrade_caasp2.prereq>>
. Disable automatic updates during the upgrade procedure. For details, see <<_sec.admin.software.upgrade_caasp2.timer>>. 
. Upgrade the nodes. For details, refer to <<_sec.admin.software.upgrade_caasp2.upgrade>>. 
. Reboot all nodes. For details, refer to <<_sec.admin.software.upgrade_caasp2.reboot>>. 


[[_sec.admin.software.upgrade_caasp2.prereq]]
=== Install {productname} 2 Updates


Before you start the upgrade procedure to {productname}
v3, you must ensure that all your nodes are running on the latest v2 updates.
You can check the [path]``SUSEConnect``
 package version to see if you are up to date.
To do so you will run a [command]``salt`` command to display the package version installed on each node. 

----
{prompt.user}``docker exec -i  $(docker ps -q -f name="salt-master") \
salt --batch 10 -P "roles:(admin|kube-(master|minion))" \

[[_sec.admin.software.upgrade_caasp2.timer]]
=== Disable Automatic Updates


To begin with the upgrade procedure, you first must disable the automatic transactional update mechanism to avoid conflicts.
To do so you must run a [command]``salt`` command across the nodes to disable the ``transactional-update.timer``. 

The automatic update timer will be re-enabled automatically after the migration procedure.

Run the update command across your nodes. 

.Batch size for upgrade
[NOTE]
====
In this example we have limited the number of nodes this step will be performed on to `10 nodes` at a time. 

This is a precaution to avoid problems on slower network connections.
If you are performing this step on a high bandwidth connection (for example from within the same datacenter as the cluster), you can raise the number of nodes by replacing the value for the (``--batch``) parameter.
It is highly recommended not to change this setting.

During the procedure the nodes will be switched to the new release channel for v3, available updates are downloaded and installed, services and applications are reconfigured and brought up in a orderly fashion. 

This operation will produce a lot of output for each node.
The entire output is mirrored to a log file [path]``transactional-update-migration.log``
 to the current working directory.
This log file can be very helpful should any of the update operations fail. 

[[_sec.admin.software.upgrade_caasp2.reboot]]
=== Reboot Cluster Nodes


To complete the procedure, you must reboot the cluster nodes.
To do this properly, use {dashboard}
to restart the nodes. 


. Log in to {dashboard} . 
. Update the Admin node as described in <<_sec.admin.software.transactional_updates.installation>>. 
. Update the remaining nodes as described in <<_sec.admin.software.transactional_updates.installation>>. 


[[_sec.admin.software.upgrade_caasp2.troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting


In case the upgrade fails, please perform the support data collection by running [command]``supportconfig`` on the affected nodes.
Provide the resulting files including the [path]``transactional-update-migration.log``
 to SUSE Support. 

[[_sec.admin.software.install]]
== Additional Software Installation


Once your cluster is ready, you may want to deploy additional software that is not installed on {productname}
by default.
This chapter provides instructions on how to install and configure {helm}
, the {kube}
package manager. 

[[_sec.admin.software.toolchain]]
=== Building Kernel Modules


Some vendors will only provide certain kernel drivers or modules as source.
In order to use these modules you must build them on the machine they are required on.
We provide a [path]``caasp-toolchain``
 module that includes all necessary tools to *build* kernel modules. 

A full list of tools and packages available through the module can be found in the https://scc.suse.com/packages?name=SUSE%20CaaS%20Platform&version=3.0&arch=x86_64&query=&module=1752[SUSE Customer Center]. 

.Reboot Required For Toolchain
[IMPORTANT]
====
The toolchain module must be enabled through [command]``transactional-update``.
Due to the nature of transactional updates, the machine must reboot at least twice.
First to activate the module and a second time to start the machine from the new snapshot that incorporates the installed tools, packages, and libraries. 

Please plan for maintenance windows when setting up toolchain usage. 
====

.Procedure: Enabling `caasp-toolchain` Module
. Log in to the machine where you wish to use the toolchain 
. Register the `caasp-toolchain` module 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update reboot register -p caasp-toolchain/3.0/x86_64`` 
----
+
The machine will reboot to incorporate the module into the read-only file system and start from the new snapshot. 
. {empty}
+
.Avoid Reboots By Installing Multiple Packages
IMPORTANT: If you wish to install multiple packages, you should install them all in a single operation.
Each time [command]``transactional-update`` is run, it creates a new snapshot and discards all previous changes.
The changes can only be persisted by starting from the new snapshot through reboot. 
+


+
Use [command]``transactional-update`` to install the desired packages from the toolchain module 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update reboot pkg in binutils kernel-devel kernel-default-devel kernel-syms kernel-macros`` 
----
+
After the operation is finished the machine will reboot and start from the new snapshots with the packages installed. 


.Procedure: Disabling `caasp-toolchain` Module

After you are done using the toolchain module, you can free up space by uninstalling the tools you no longer need and disable the toolchain module. 
. Uninstall the packages you no longer need 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update reboot pkg rm binutils kernel-devel kernel-default-devel kernel-syms kernel-macros`` 
----
+
The machine will reboot and start from the new snapshot without these packages. 
. Disable the toolchain module 
+

----
{prompt.root}``transactional-update reboot register -d -p caasp-toolchain/3.0/x86_64`` 
----
+
The machine will reboot and start from the new snapshot without the module registered. 


[[_sec.admin.software.helm]]
=== Deploying {helm} and {tiller}

{helm}
has two parts: {helm}
is the client and {tiller}
is the server component. {helm}
runs on your remote workstation that has access to your cluster, and {tiller}
is installed as a container on {productname}
when you run {dashboard}
for the first time.
(See <<_sec.deploy.nodes.admin_configuration>>.) 

You should match the {helm}
version with the version of {tiller}
that is running on your cluster.
The {tiller}
binary cannot report its version, and you need the version that is packaged inside the {tiller}
container.
Run the following command from your workstation to query the logs: 

----
{prompt.root}``kubectl logs -l name=tiller --namespace=kube-system | grep "Starting Tiller"`` [main] 2018/04/04 16:48:27 Starting{tiller}v2.6.1 (tls=false)
----


If the log gets overwritten and loses this information, the following command queries the [command]``rpm`` package manager inside the container.
This works only on {productname}
/{scf}
 installations: 

----
{prompt.root}``kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -n kube-system | awk '/tiller/{print$1}') \
-n kube-system -- rpm -q helm`` helm-2.6.1-1.6.x86_64
----


If the Linux distribution on your workstation doesn't provide the correct {helm}
version, or you are using some other platform, see the https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart[ Helm Quickstart Guide] for installation instructions and basic usage examples.
Download the matching {helm}
 binary into any directory that is in your PATH on your workstation, such as your [path]``~/bin``
 directory.
Then initialize just the client part: 

----
{prompt.user}``helm init --client-only`` 
----


The {tiller}
version that ships with {productname}
is supported by {suse}
.
While {suse}
does not provide support for third-party {helm}
charts, you can easily use them if necessary. 

[[_sec.admin.software.helm.installing_heapster]]
=== Example: Installing heapster
