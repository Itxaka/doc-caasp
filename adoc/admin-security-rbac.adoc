= Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

== Introduction

RBAC uses the `rbac.authorization.k8s.io` API group to drive authorization decisions, allowing administrators to dynamically configure policies through the {kube} API.

The authentication components are deployed with {productname} installation. Administrators can update LDAP identity providers before or after platform deployment.
After your {productname} deployment, administrators can then use {kube} RBAC to design user or group authorization.
Users can access with a web browser to do the authentication and self-configure `kubectl` to access authorized resources.

== Authentication Flow

Authentication is composed of two open source libraries:

* link:https://github.com/dexidp/dex[Dex] is an identity provider service (idP) that uses link:https://openid.net/connect/[OIDC] (Open ID Connect) to drive authentication for client application. It acts as portal to defer authentication to provider through connected identity providers(connectors).
* link:https://github.com/heptiolabs/gangway[Gangway], a client application that enables authentication flow for your {productname}. User can login, authorize access and self-configure `kubectl`.

For RBAC, administrators can use `kubectl` to create corresponding `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` for a user or group to limit resource access.

. User requests access through Gangway.
. Gangway redirects to Dex.
. Dex redirects to connected identity provider (connector). User login and approve access request are generated.
. Dex continues with OIDC authentication flow on behalf of the user and creates/updates data to {kube}  CRDs.
. Dex redirects the user to Gangway. This redirect includes (ID/refresh) tokens.
. Gangway returns `kubectl` self-configure instructions to the user.

. User self-configures `kubectl`.
. The `kubectl` connects to {kube} API-server.
. {kube} CRDs validate {kube} API-server request and return response.
. The `kubectl` connects to authorized {kube} resources through {kube} API-server.

== RBAC Operations

=== Administration

==== {kube} Role Binding

Administrators can create {kube} `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` for users.
This grants permission to users on the {kube} cluster like in the example below.

Create a `RoleBinding` for `<USER-1>`, `<USER-2>`, and `<GROUP-1>` using the `ClusterRole` `admin`.

----
$ kubectl create rolebinding admin --clusterrole=admin --user=<USER-1> --user=<USER-2> --group=<GROUP-1>
----

==== Update The Authentication Connector

Administrators can update the authentication connector settings after {productname} deployment as follows:

. Open the `dex` configmap in `<cluster name>/addons/dex/dex.yaml`
. Adapt ConfigMap by adding LDAP configuration to the connector section of config.yaml data. The detailed configurations for LDAP connector, refer to https://github.com/dexidp/dex/blob/master/Documentation/connectors/ldap.md.
+
====
# Example LDAP connector

  connectors:
  - type: ldap
    id: ldap
    name: openLDAP
    config:
      host: dirsrv-389ds.kube-system.svc.cluster.local:389
      insecureNoSSL: true
      insecureSkipVerify: true
      bindDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org
      bindPW: 'admin'
      usernamePrompt: Email Address
      userSearch:
        baseDN: cn=People,dc=example,dc=org
        filter: "(objectClass=person)"
        username: mail
        idAttr: DN
        emailAttr: mail
        nameAttr: uid
====
+
Besides the LDAP connector you can also setup other connectors.
For additional connectors, refer to the available connector configurations in the Dex repository: https://github.com/dexidp/dex/tree/master/Documentation/connectors.
. Update Dex deployment.
+
----
kubectl replace --force -f <cluster-name>/addons/dex/dex.yaml
----

=== User Access

==== Setup `kubectl`

. Go to the login page at `+https://<CONTROL-PLANE IP/FQDN>:32001/+` in your browser.
. Click "login".
. Choose the login method.
. Enter the login credentials.
. Approve the access request.
. Self-configure `kubectl` with provided setup instruction.

==== Access {kube} Resources

The user can now access resources in the authorized `<NAMESPACE>`.

If the user has the proper permissions to access the resources, the output should look like this:

----
# kubectl -n <NAMESPACE> get pod

If the user does not have the right permissions to access a resource, they will receive a `Forbidden` message.
