  Once your cluster is ready, you may want to deploy additional software
  that is not installed on &productname; by default. This chapter provides
  instructions on how to install and configure &helm;, the &kube; package 
  manager, and then how to install the &kube; Dashboard. If you intend to 
  deploy &scf; on &productname;, &helm; is required.

  <title>Deploying &helm; and &tiller;</title>
  <para>
   &helm; has two parts: &helm; is the client and &tiller; is the server component. 
   &helm; runs on your remote workstation that has access to your cluster, and 
   &tiller; is installed as a container on &productname; when you run &dashboard; 
   for the first time. (See <xref linkend="sec.caasp.installquick.conf"/>.)
  </para>
  
  <para>
   You should match the &helm; version with the version of &tiller; 
   that is running on your cluster. The &tiller; binary cannot report its
   version, and you need the version that is packaged inside the &tiller; 
   container. Run the following command from your workstation to query the
   logs:
  </para>
  <screen>
   &prompt.user; kubectl logs -l name=tiller --namespace=kube-system | grep "Starting &tiller;"
   [main] 2018/04/04 16:48:27 Starting &tiller; v2.6.1 (tls=false)
  </screen>
  <para>
   If the log gets overwritten and loses this information, the following command 
   queries the <command>rpm</command> package manager inside the container. This
   works only on &productname;/&scf; installations:
  </para>
  <screen>
   &prompt.user; kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -n kube-system | awk '/tiller/{print$1}') -n kube-system -- rpm -q helm
   helm-2.6.1-1.6.x86_64
  </screen>
  
  <para>
   If the Linux distribution on your workstation doesn't provide the correct 
   &helm; version, or you are using some other platform, see the 
   <link xlink:href="https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart"> &helm; Quickstart Guide</link>
   for installation instructions and basic usage examples. Download the matching
   &helm; binary into any directory that is in your PATH on your workstation,
   such as your <filename>~/bin</filename> directory. Then initialize just the
   client part:
  </para>
  <screen>
   &prompt.user;helm init --client-only
  </screen>
  
  <para>
   The &tiller; version that ships with &productname; is supported by &suse;. While 
   &suse; does not provide support for third-party &helm; charts, you can easily 
   use them if necessary.
