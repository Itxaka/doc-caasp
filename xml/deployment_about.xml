<title>About &productname;</title>
 </info>
 
 <para>
  &productname; is a platform designed for fast deployment of container-based applications. You can deploy &productname; on you physical machines or you can use it on virtual machines. After you deploy it, it is ready to run out of the box. It provides high scalability of your cluster&mdash;from 10 to 1000 nodes. 
 </para>
 <para>
  &productname; was designed to simplify transformation of applications into container-based applications. Creating clouds with container-based application is much easier as you get rid off problems with compatibility and depenencies. To enable as fast application deployment as possible, it is recommended to use container orchestration framework, e.g. Kubernetes.
 </para>
 <para>
  While &productname; inherits benefits of &sle; uses tools and technologies well-known to system administrators&mdash;like <literal>cloud-init</literal>,  Kubernetes or Salt&mdash;the main inovation (compared to &sls;) comes with <emphasis role="bold">transactional updates</emphasis>. A transactional update is an update that can be installed when the system is running without any down time. The transaction update can be rolled back, so if the upgrade fails or the update is not compatible with your infrastructure, you can restore the previous state.

  <para>
   A typical &productname; cluster consists of several types of nodes:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     &admin_node; - is a &smaster; that assigns roles to &sminion;s. The node runs the GUI dashboard that manages the whole cluster.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
    &node; - is a &sminion; that can have a following role:
     <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
    <para>
     Kubernetes master - that manages all containers.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Kubernetes worker - that runs containers.

    </para>
   </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </para>
   </listitem>   
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   In large-scale clusters, there are other nodes that can help you to manage and run the cluster:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     a local &smt; server that manages subscriptions for workers and so decreases the traffic to &scc;
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     a log server that stores logs of cluster nodes.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   The following figure illustrates interactions of the nodes.

  <sect2 xml:id="administration_dashboard">
   <title>The Administration Node</title>
   <para>
    The &admin_node; is intended to manage deployment of the cluster and runs applications required for a proper function of the cluster. The &admin_node; runs the administration dashboard called &dashboard;, the <emphasis>salt-api</emphasis>, the MariaDB database, the <literal>salt-master</literal> and <literal>salt-minion</literal>. The dashboard, database and daemons all run in containers.
   </para>
   <para>
   The &salt; daemons are used to manage the cluster nodes and to handle incoming/outgoing communication between nodes. The MariaDB database stores the dashboard data and &salt; events (commands completions, new &sminion;s that require registration, etc.). 
   </para>
   <para>
   The dashboard is a web application that enables you to manage, monitor and deploy the cluster. The dashboard manages the cluster by using the <emphasis>salt-api</emphasis> to interact with the underlying &salt; technology. 
   </para>
   <para>
   The containers on the &admin_node; are managed by <literal>kubelet</literal> as a static pod. Bear in mind that this <literal>kubelet</literal> does not managed the cluster nodes. Each cluster node has its own running instance of <literal>kubelet</literal>.
